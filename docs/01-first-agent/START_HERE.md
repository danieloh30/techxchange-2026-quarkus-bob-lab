# Exercise 1 — Agent + Tool: TriageAgent + TriageTool

<span class="badge badge--code-along">Code-Along</span>

**Timebox:** 15 minutes  
**Persona:** Sam — NOC analyst  
**You work in:** `lab/` (keep Quarkus running — hot reload)  
**Files to edit:**

- `lab/src/main/java/com/incidentmanagement/agentic/agents/TriageAgent.java`
- `lab/src/main/java/com/incidentmanagement/agentic/tools/TriageTool.java`

!!! tip "Solution fallback"
    [`solutions/01-first-agent`](https://github.com/danieloh30/techxchange-2026-quarkus-bob-lab/tree/main/solutions/01-first-agent){:target="_blank"} — open if stuck.

## The goal

Declare your first **agent + tool** pair: the agent reasons over natural-language incident reports, and the tool acts on the real world (mutating database state). By the end, processing a critical report flips status to `TRIAGING` with a tool call in the logs; a minor report produces `TRIAGE_NOT_REQUIRED` with no tool call.

The agent+tool pattern is the fundamental building block of agentic AI: the LLM **decides**, the tool **executes**. Everything else in this lab builds on this pattern.

---

## Step 0 — Start the lab project (2 min)

```bash
cd lab
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-lab-key-here
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080){:target="_blank"}** — you'll see the Incident Dashboard with 8 seeded incidents but no agent behavior yet (processing will fail — that's expected, you haven't wired the agents).

---

## Step 1 — Implement `TriageAgent` (5 min)

Open [`TriageAgent.java`](https://github.com/danieloh30/techxchange-2026-quarkus-bob-lab/blob/main/lab/src/main/java/com/incidentmanagement/agentic/agents/TriageAgent.java){:target="_blank"}.

The method signature is already declared. Add these annotations **above** it:

```java
@SystemMessage("""
    You handle intake for the triage department of an IT incident management system.
    It is your job to submit a request to the provided requestTriage function
    to take action based on the provided incident report.
    Be specific about what triage actions are needed.
    If no triage action is needed based on the report, respond with "TRIAGE_NOT_REQUIRED".
    """)
@UserMessage("""
    Incident Information:
    System: {incidentInfo.system}
    Service: {incidentInfo.service}
    Priority: P{incidentInfo.priority}
    Incident Number: {incidentNumber}

    Report: {report}
    """)
@Agent(description = "Triage specialist. Determines initial triage and team assignment.",
       outputKey = "analysisResult")
@ToolBox(TriageTool.class)
```

??? info "Why `outputKey = \"analysisResult\"`?"
    `AgenticScope` is a shared context map passed through a workflow. Every agent writes its result under its `outputKey` so the next agent can read it. Without `outputKey`, the result is silently dropped and downstream agents find nothing. This is the single most common cause of workflow failures.

??? info "Why is this an interface, not a class?"
    Quarkus LangChain4j generates the CDI proxy at build time. The framework manages the LLM call, message formatting, and tool invocation. You declare *what* to do via annotations; the framework handles *how*.

---

## Step 2 — Implement `TriageTool` (4 min)

Open [`TriageTool.java`](https://github.com/danieloh30/techxchange-2026-quarkus-bob-lab/blob/main/lab/src/main/java/com/incidentmanagement/agentic/tools/TriageTool.java){:target="_blank"}.

Add the following method inside the class (replace the `// TODO` block):

```java
@Tool("Requests initial triage with the specified options")
@Transactional
public String requestTriage(
        Integer incidentNumber,
        String system,
        String service,
        Integer priority,
        boolean assignOnCall,
        boolean notifyStakeholders,
        boolean createWarRoom,
        boolean linkRelatedIncidents,
        String triageNotes) {

    IncidentInfo incidentInfo = IncidentInfo.findById(incidentNumber);
    if (incidentInfo != null) {
        incidentInfo.status = IncidentStatus.TRIAGING;
        incidentInfo.persist();
    }

    StringBuilder summary = new StringBuilder();
    summary.append("Triage requested for ").append(system).append("/")
           .append(service).append(" (P").append(priority).append("), Incident #")
           .append(incidentNumber).append(":\n");
    if (assignOnCall)        summary.append("- Assign on-call engineer\n");
    if (notifyStakeholders)  summary.append("- Notify stakeholders\n");
    if (createWarRoom)       summary.append("- Create war room\n");
    if (linkRelatedIncidents) summary.append("- Link related incidents\n");
    if (triageNotes != null && !triageNotes.isEmpty())
        summary.append("Notes: ").append(triageNotes);

    Log.info("  └─ TriageTool activated for incident #" + incidentNumber);
    return summary.toString();
}
```

??? info "Why `@Transactional` here but not on `TriageAgent`?"
    `IncidentInfo.persist()` writes to the PostgreSQL database. JPA requires an active transaction for mutations. `TriageAgent` is an LLM-backed interface (no JPA operations) — adding `@Transactional` there would have no effect and would mislead future readers.

??? info "Why `@ApplicationScoped` on the tool class?"
    Tools are CDI beans injected into the LLM call context. They must be scoped. `@ApplicationScoped` is the correct scope — tools hold no per-request state.

Save both files. Quarkus hot-reloads automatically.

## Step 3 — Understand the agent loop

Before testing, trace the execution path in your head:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'look':'handDrawn','theme':'neutral','themeVariables': {'lineColor':'#4A4035'}}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as processTriage()
    participant LLM as LLM
    participant Tool as TriageTool

    App->>+LLM: @UserMessage (incident info + report)
    Note right of LLM: Analyzes report
    LLM->>+Tool: tool_call: requestTriage(#5, ...)
    Note right of Tool: status → TRIAGING
    Tool-->>-LLM: "Triage requested for email-service..."
    LLM-->>-App: → AgenticScope["analysisResult"]
```

The LLM decides *whether* to call the tool based on the `@SystemMessage` policy. If the report says "false alarm, no action needed", the LLM produces `TRIAGE_NOT_REQUIRED` directly — no tool call.

---

## Step 4 — Test it (4 min)

Open **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080){:target="_blank"}**, click **View** on Incident **#5** (email-service/notification-api, status: `OPEN`), and process it with:

<img src="../../images/incident-detail-panel.png" alt="Detail panel for processing an incident" style="width:100%;max-width:480px;display:block;margin:1rem auto;border-radius:8px;box-shadow:0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">

Enter this report in the detail panel:

```
Order confirmation emails failing for 30% of customers, bounce rate spiking
```

**Expected terminal logs:**
```
WARN  [de.la.ag.ag.AgentInvocationHandler] Improper invocation of a standalone agent outside of an agentic system, consider using AiServices instead.
INFO  [co.in.ag.to.TriageTool]   └─ TriageTool activated for incident #5
```

The warning is expected — `TriageAgent` has `@Agent` but isn't part of a workflow yet. Exercise 4 wires it into the full pipeline and the warning disappears.

**Expected UI:** Incident #5 status → `TRIAGING`

!!! tip "Agentic Dev UI"
    Open the [Agentic Dev UI](http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui/quarkus-langchain4j-agentic/agents){:target="_blank"} to see all registered agents, their `outputKey`, sub-agents, and wiring. This is the fastest way to confirm your agent compiled and was picked up by the framework.

Now process Incident **#6** (search-engine/product-search, status: `OPEN`) with:
```
False alarm, search relevance is back to normal after cache refresh
```

**Expected:** UI status changes to `RESOLVED`; **no** `TriageTool activated` in terminal logs — the LLM decided no action was needed.

<div class="done-when" markdown>

## :material-check-circle: Done when

- [ ] Tool call visible in logs for critical incident; status changes to `TRIAGING`
- [ ] No tool call for false-alarm report; status changes to `RESOLVED`
- [ ] You can explain from memory: why `@Transactional` on the tool but not the agent
- [ ] You can explain from memory: what `outputKey` does and what breaks without it

</div>

!!! note
    **Keep Quarkus running** — Exercise 2 adds the next agent with hot reload.
